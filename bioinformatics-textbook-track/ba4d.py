# Compute the Number of Peptides of Given Total Mass

from functools import cache
from ba4c import mass

# The total number of ways to create a peptide of mass e.g. 1024 can be
# calculated as the sum over ways to create a peptide of mass (1024-aa) for each
# aa in the list of amino acid masses. These sub masses then be calculated
# recursively...

# Note that for the possible amino acid matches, we use the *set* of masses (not
# all masses, which differs because some amino acids have the same mass). This
# effectively means we do not count multiple solutions with different amino
# acids of the same weight! This is IMO a bug in rosalind as these should be
# counted.
