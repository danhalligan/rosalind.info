## Running the solutions

Each problem is solved in a separate file.

To run this tool to solve a particular problem, you can either run the script
(providing the input file as a command line argument) or use `solve.py` which
will solve based on the input file name.

```{shell}
python3 ini.py test/rosalind_fibo.txt
```

```{shell}
./solve.py test/rosalind_fibo.txt
```
