# Identifying Maximal Repeats

# This is a bit messy, but the idea here is that we take a suffix tree and
# for each node with children, we get the full path (concatenated edge
# labels) from root. This sequence must be a repeat (since the node has
# children).
#
# Out list `edges` in `main()` contains these paths (from each node with
# children) and the (total) number of descendants that node has.
# Now for each possible number of descendants (which is related to the number
# of repeats), we ensure that we have the maximal repeat by excluding any
# sequences that are fully contained inside others with the same number of
# children.
