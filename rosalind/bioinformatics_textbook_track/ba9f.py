# Find the Shortest Non-Shared Substring of Two Strings

# We have to be careful here as the title is misleading. We actually need
# The shortest substring of **Text1** that does not appear in **Text2**
#
# The logic here is that we can find the shortest a non-shared sequence by
# finding the sequence from the root up to a non-purple node.
# For the shortest non-shared sequence, we don't need to consider nodes
# deeper in the tree and we also only need the first character of the final
# edge to the non-purple node (since as soon as we add this character, we
# have a subsequence unique to one of the sequences).
#
# Since we're only interested in subsequences present in Text1, we condition
# on our final node being red.
